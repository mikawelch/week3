Me Object
Create a new .html file named "me.html" in a repo named "week3"
Set up the basic HTML template, with head and body
In a script tag, create a new object and store it in a variable called "me"
In the object, add the following keys:
family (object)
create a key for "guardians" and make it an array
Each item in the array will be an object with the following keys
name
nickname
age
create a key for "siblings" and make it an array
each item in the array will be an object with the following keys
name
favorite (boolean)
age
pets (array)
each item in the array must be an object with the following keys:
name
species
still_alive (boolean)
nicknames
an array of string nicknames for that pet 
childhood (object)
favorite_movie (string)
favorite_food (string)
adulthood
favorite_movie(string)
favorite_food(string)
I will "ask" this object for 3 pieces of information:

your first guardians nickname 
I will use the code "me.family.guardians[0].nickname" to access it
is your first pet still alive?
I will use the code "me.pets[0].still_alive"
your favorite foods
I will use the code me.childhood.favorite_food and me.adulthood.favorite_food
I will also be looking for proper indentation on this object. Please refer to the in-class example file if needed,
